Compared with [this animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-umuLfQWCLo) of the same process in Disco, the bottleneck at the activity "Analyze Request for Quotation" is not visible here. Perhaps there might be a way to show the movement of the tokens along the arrows and keep the different tokens separate from each other. This could make congestions more visible.
